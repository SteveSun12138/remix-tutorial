# Remix tutorial



## Quickstart

- This step only applies if you've opted out of having the CLI install dependencies for you:
  
  ```sh
  npx remix init
  ```

- Initial setup: _If you just generated this project, this step has been done for you._

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
